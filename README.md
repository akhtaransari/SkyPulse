## Technologies Employed

SkyPulse combines the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a seamless weather experience:

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for dynamic functionality

## Behind the Scenes

- The `index.html` file forms the foundation of the app, housing input elements, buttons, and data containers.
- The `style.css` file creatively designs the app with carefully chosen colors, fonts, and a layout that adapts gracefully across various devices.
- The `script.js` file encompasses the core logic of fetching weather and forecast data via the OpenWeatherMap API. It handles user interactions, such as searching for weather data and displaying the user's current location.
